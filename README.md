Material for the workshop on ggplot by Olga Ivanova, Sarah Stolle and Janine Khuc on the 30th of April. The repo consists of two R- scripts that are the exercises, a handout and a dataset named fastfood_calories.csv where the original dataset comes from https://fastfoodnutrition.org/ and was cleaned for visualisation purposes for #TidyTuesday https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday
